        <span>This painting, The Grocer's Shop,
         can serve as a pendant to The 
         Poultry Seller, which was painted 
         by the father of Frans van Mieris 
         the Younger and is also on display. 
         The egg basket at the upper right 
         appears to have been passed down 
         through the generations.</span>
