        “Virgin and Child”
      </h3>

      <p class="murillo__text">
        Murillo’s paintings of the Virgin and Child are popular because he imbues
        the traditional theme with a sense of intimacy and sweetness. This is
        evident in the soft modeling of the figures, as well as in the infant’s
        momentary glance away from the Virgin.
